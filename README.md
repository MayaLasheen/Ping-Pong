# Ping-Pong-Game
<p>
<li> The game has two paddles and a ball that bounces back and forth between them. </li>
<li> The level of difficulty of the game is varied by varying the speed of the ball using the switches on the FPGA. </li>
<li> The scores are kept track of and once a player has reached the maximum predefined score (3), game over. </li>
<li> Vivado Webpack 2022.1 and Basys3 FPGA Board were used for this project. </li>
